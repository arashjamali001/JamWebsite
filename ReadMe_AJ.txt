as i am following the django book, profesional series. I need to write down how much progress or which chapter I am in following the book.

March6 update:

this is until begining of chapter-4 (pages app)in django pro book page-70 more accurate. I need to check if the superuser is already created or not and what is the user/pass for that.
the focus should be how we can put htmls that we have to templates folder. 

To start website i just need to type " docker-compose up -d"
i should be in "base" environment for start the docker.
 in this work  The superuser is arashjamali pass is : Ramz#1JamWebsite
 Email is aj_jamali@outlook.com

it seems i have been in "base" conda environment when I used pipenv for insatlling dependencies
it is not a good practice but as everything kinda works i keep doing so.
As I had to remake imgae  all database is gone and need to remake superuser.
on jun 23, ready for production, however need to take care of allowed_HOSTS later
