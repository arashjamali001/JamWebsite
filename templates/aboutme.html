							<p>Hello! I appreciate your interest in learning more about me. I am Arash (/AH-r-ae-sh/), an engineer with a wide range of interests. 
								I was born in Iran and immigrated to the United States in my early 20s. I am married and have two dogs! 
								I enjoy trucks, virtual engineering tools, and mountain biking. I know, it's quite a diverse set of interests. 
								Perhaps that's why I decided to create this website â€“ I want to share my thoughts and passions with a broader audience, 
								extending beyond just my colleagues and friends.
								I also find enjoyment in creating small computer codes for fun. During weekends, I often engage in minor house projects 
								or fine-tune our bikes in preparation for a weekend ride. 
								My preferred method of accomplishing tasks is by listening to podcasts in the background.   
							</p>
							<p>    
								I don't believe a college degree is a strict necessity for success in today's technology or automotive industries, 
								but I do see merit in formal education. While my academic background is in mechanical engineering, 
								I had the opportunity to explore other subjects such as software and chemical engineering, particularly during my graduate studies.

								The most significant lesson I gained from my PhD experience was the ability to approach problems objectively and seek measurable indices, 
								setting aside personal feelings and speculations. This analytical approach is not typically acquired during undergraduate education, and it
								 stands as one of the most valuable aspects of a robust PhD program.
							</p>
							<p>
								Last but not least, I would highly value any feedback on my blog posts or an opportunity to engage in further discussions! 
								It's important to note that my blog posts solely reflect my personal opinions and do not necessarily represent the stance of any companies. 
								Please don't hesitate to reach out via email at "ajamali at mtu dot edu" or connect with me on LinkedIn. 
							</p>

							<p> -Cheers!</p>	
							<p> Arash </p>
